## Links in Dash Bootstrap dataframes

I need to be able to easily create hyperlinks for a table from dataframe, the easiest way being based on another column in the same dataframe. This will wrap `column` in the link from `column_HREF` by default. You can specify a different suffix.

Still a work in progress, I need to get setup.py and such working.
